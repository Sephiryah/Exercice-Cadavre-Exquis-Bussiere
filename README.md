# Story of the Tall Blue Chaperone

Once upon a time, a Tall Blue Chaperone. She is a Tall girl that walk regularly on the woods. She hunts the Little Kind Wolf in this woods while the Wolf passes by to join his kid. One day, the Little Kind Wolf found one of his kids in these woods. The kids, we call him "Jean-Eude", say to his dad that the Tall Blue Chaperone kidnaped his brother and sister.

His dad went crazy and started to call all of his friends to join him, he was known in the forest so everybody accept his call.
He made a big meeting and everybody was there, the deer, the foxes, the bears, all the birds, etc,.. The wolf's dad started to talk and explain to everybody that his sons were kidnapped by the tall blue chaperone and they need to do something.

the Bear, who was very close to Papa Loup, took the lead in organizing the operation so that the little cubs were safe and sound and as his 3 groups of animals went towards the road feeling the sons of the wolves

All animals hunted down every human they found.
Thus the forest was feared for its fierce predators.
No human ever came close again.
